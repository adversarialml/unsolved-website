Unsolved Machine Learning is a curated list of major unanswered questions and problems in machine learning. When doing machine learning research, it is easy to forget the bigger picture. There have been many substantial achievements in machine learning recently such as AlphaGo defeating a Go world champion, surpassing human level performance in image recognition, and generating realistic images using generative adversarial networks. Given these achievements, it may appear as if we are right at the cusp of an artificial intelligence revolution -- and perhaps this may be true -- but there are still significant unanswered questions to be solved that are often forgotten about.
